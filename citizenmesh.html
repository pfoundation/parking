<p>Internet advanced over the last few years but nearly half the world population isn’t connected.</p>

<p>The Middle East is one of the most challenging regions with unstable connections caused by wars,  poverty, and infrastructure challenges.</p>

<p>The P Foundation was established in 2021 to invest in journalism, technology, and in the success of the nations in which we operate.</p>

<p>We believe that an informed, engaged, equitable and inclusive community can pursue its true interests, and an open internet is key to achieve informed citizenry.</p>

<h2 id="Citizens Mesh">Citizens Mesh</h2>
<p><b>A joint program between SpaceX, Qatar Foundation and P Foundation.</b></p>

<p>Brief: the program provides internet access to over five million individuals.</p>

<p>The launch of Starlink by SpaceX simplified the access of the internet, however the cost of access remains beyond the means of average citizens.</p>

<p>Citizen Mesh aims to close this digital divide by reducing technical and financial barriers, paving the way for people and communities to thrive.</p>

<p>As we use Starlink to access the global internet, we work with local communities and passionate people to deploy creative solutions that allows us to maximize the benefits of access bringing the internet to everyone.</p>

<p>We prioritize access to schools, universities, public libraries and public parks.  </p>

<p>With our creative solutions, free wifi access is extended to everyone within 300 meter radius, and the mesh network can be accessed by anyone with the right router within 15km.</p>

<p>The program intends to connect 4000 communities in three years, with an average community size of 500 people.  Combined with our Citizens Network program (provides small grants, technical aid and training for local communities to run their own mesh networks) local communities would be able to extend the network on their own, reaching an additional 750 households.</p>

<p>With this in mind, the program would be reaching over 2M in direct connectivity and 3M in extended reach.</p>

<h2 id="Funding Requirements">Funding Requirements</h2>

<p>Each community requires an average of $900 to set up, along with the internet monthly subscription which averages at $417.00, bringing the yearly cost to $5,900.00.</p>

<p>With these figures into consideration, the monthly cost per connected individual is shy of $0.50 ($0.39 to be specific).</p>

<p>The program is seeking $24m in funding. The funding would allow us to reduce barriers to access, and make it faster and cheaper.</p>

<p>Together, we don’t just build and maintain connections. Please refer to the extended study for detailed funding requirements, and continuity plan.</p>

<h2 id="Qatar Foundation">Qatar Foundation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For over two decades, Qatar Foundation has been driving regional innovation and entrepreneurship, fostering social development and a culture of lifelong learning, and preparing our brightest minds to tackle tomorrow’s biggest challenges.</p>
<p>At the heart of everything we do is the knowledge that our future lies in unlocking the most precious resource of all—human potential.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Citizens mesh extend the soft power of QF, allowing the foundation to spread its message further, by having direct undistributed reach to the 5M person.</p>

<p>The connected individuals will be presented hourly with educational content curated and developed by QF researchers.  </p>

<p>QF researchers will also be setting the priorities on which countries and communities receive access first.</p>

<p>The program would also provide QF research with insights about the communities interest, behavior.  </p>
