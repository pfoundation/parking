# P Foundation Peering Policy
P Foundation is a non profit organisation established in 2021 to help advance democracy by fighting blackouts and connecting those in need.
To help acheive our goal, we maintain multiple interconnected networks that prioritize user privacy.

## Peering Requests
Any external party that intends to peer with P Foundation AS399728 must have an up-to-date and fully completed entry with PeeringDB.

We generally offer open peering policy, and we make our network available in all IXs we operate in. 
Peering requests should come via email to peering@p.foundation. 


## Peering Recommendation
In order to offer more connectivity quality and performance, P Foundation operates an international network (AS399728) and welcomes the opportunity to engage in peering with responsible BGP speakers that meet our minimum requirements and are present at mutual Internet Exchanges or data center facilities.

- Peers must operate a public and visible ASN.
- Where multiple connections to an IX exist, peers must establish BGP sessions with all neighbors and enable multipath routing.
- P Foundation has not established a minimum bandwidth threshold for establishing peering.
- Both parties are expected to register their routes in a public Internet Routing Registry (IRR) database, for the purpose of filtering. Both parties shall make good faith efforts to keep this information up to date.
- Either party may accept or reject peering requests as network management needs require.
- Neither party shall establish a static route, a route of last resort, or otherwise send traffic to the other party for a route not announced via BGP.
- Neither party shall announce to the other the more specific routes of prefixes learned via a third-party transit customer.
- Both parties will exchange only Unicast IPv4/6 routes.
- Both parties must maintain an up to date PeeringDB entry, including a 24x7 NOC Contact.
- P Foundation does not require use of an MD5 key for protecting BGPv4 sessions, but we can do it if requested.
- P Foundation requires the other party to register their routes in the RPKI repository using Route Object Authorization (ROA) objects.
- Peers are encouraged to implement Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS).
